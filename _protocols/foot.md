---

Basic forefoot protocol used for the imaging of suspected pathology distal to the naviculocuneiform joint. This protocol does not attempt to include the ankle and is orientated to the plane of the metatarsals and the pitch axis of the forefoot.

Useful to assess:

* Arthropathies of the midfoot, TMT, MTP and interphalangeal joints of the toes
* Plantar plate injury
* Morton's neuroma
* Tendon and ligament injury
* Diabetic ulceration and osteomyelitis (see adaptations)
* Soft tissue masses

**Single digit sequences should be utilised for high resolution tendon imaging**

### Positioning
Forefoot well padded and centred in foot & ankle coil.

### Scan
- High resolution foot & ankle coil
- Base FOV 120mm Â± 1mm
- Orthogonal planes based on axis of metatarsals

| Sequence				|	Slice / Gap |
|---							|---				|
| T1 Long axis	    | 2.5mm / 0.3mm |
| PDFS Long axis  | 2.5mm / 0.3mm |
| T2FS transverse | 3mm / 0.3mm |
| PDFS sagittal   | 2.5mm / 0.3mm |

## Variants

### Suspected infection or mass lesion

Replace PDFS and T2FS with STIR

### Coping with metalwork

* Increase slice thickness and gap
* High bandwith STIR or PDFS (MARS/SEMAC)

### Single digit or high resolution tendon series

* Reduce FOV and coverage to crop to single digit (range MTPJ to penultimate IPJ)
* Increase spatial resolution of non-SSFP sequences

| Sequence				|	Slice / Gap |
|---							|---				|
| T1 Long axis	    | 2.5mm / 0.3mm |
| PDFS Long axis  | 2.5mm / 0.3mm |
| T2FS transverse | 3mm / 0.3mm |
| VIBE Sagittal | 0.3mm isotropic |
