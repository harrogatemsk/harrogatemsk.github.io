body_part: pelvis

### Indications
- Under 50-years old
- Suspected acetabular labral tear
- Suspected hip cartilage damage
- Hip dysplasia with risk of the above

#### Prerequisites
- Plain film pelvic x-ray
- Referral by consultant orthopaedic surgeon or hip fellow

### Arthrogram
- Can be injected using fluoroscopy _or_ ultrasound as per operator preference
- Imaging ideally within 1-hour of injection (maximum upper limit 2-hrs)
- Hip to be exercised prior to scan to increase contrast penetration
- Whichever method is chosen, **intra-articular air must be absolutely avoided** through good injection technique. This is more readily achieved _without_ the use of extension tubing.

### MRI Scan
- Patient positioned supine in centre of MR table
- Body coil placed around injected hip as closely applied to skin as possible
- Patients foot and patella must point towards ceiling to orientate hip correctly
