Second line imaging for suspected occult hip fracture, or other fracture around the pelvis (clasically pubic rami or sacrum) responsible for the symptoms. Also picks up significant muscle sprains and contusions with relative frequency. 

Although this is not something to image for in the elderly, it can act as a useful explanation for reduced ability to mobilise and recover.

### Coverage
