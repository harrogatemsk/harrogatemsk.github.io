This very common scan aims to image the spine between T11 and S2 and has a range of variations tailored to different clinical questions and underlying pathologies.

### Positioning

The patient lies supine on the scan table with the arms by their side. It is important to ensure comfort to reduce motion artefact.

### Basic Scan
- Lower spine coil array
- FOV to cover between T11 and S2
- Saturation band applied to cover the aorta, parallel to the orientation of the spine
- Sagittal images must scan out far enough lateral to include neural foramina
- Axial images should be narrow FOV such that abdmominal viscera are excluded and a vertebra fills at least 75% of the ouput image
- Axial images cover visible pathological levels _or_ if none are identified, the lower 3 intervertebral levels

|	Sequence			|	TE / TR			|	Slice / Gap / Matrix		|
|---					|---				|---							|
| T1 Sagittal			| 10 / 300			| 4mm / 0.5mm / ???				|
| T2 Sagittal			| 80 / 3500			| 4mm / 0.5mm / ???				|
| T2 Axial				| 65 / 3500			| 3mm / 0.3mm / ???				|

### STIR sequence
- Patients < 30yrs routinely to help detect acute pars fracture
- Oncology or infection cases

|	Sequence			|	TE / TR			|	Slice / Gap / Matrix		|
|---					|---				|---							|
| T2 STIR				| 50 / 4000			| 4mm / 0.5mm / ???				|

### Contrast sequences
- Only when protocolled by radiologist
	- Neurosurgical
    - Oncology
    - Lesion characterisation
    - Infection

|	Sequence			|	TE / TR			|	Slice / Gap / Matrix		|
|---					|---				|---							|
| T1 Sagittal post Gd	| 10 / 300			| 4mm / 0.5mm / ???				|
| T1 Axial post Gd		| 10 / 300			| 3mm / 0.5mm / ???				|
