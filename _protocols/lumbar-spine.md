This very common scan aims to image the spine between T11 and S2 and has a range of variations tailored to different clinical questions and underlying pathologies.

### Positioning

The patient lies supine on the scan table with the arms by their side. It is important to ensure comfort to reduce motion artefact.

### Basic Scan
- Lower spine coil array
- FOV to cover between T11 and S2
- Saturation band applied to cover the aorta, parallel to the orientation of the spine
- Sagittal images must scan out far enough lateral to include neural foramina
- Axial images should be narrow FOV such that abdmominal viscera are excluded and a vertebra fills at least 75% of the ouput image
- Axial images cover visible pathological levels _or_ if none are identified, the lower 3 intervertebral levels

### STIR sequence
- Patients < 30yrs routinely to help detect acute pars fracture
- Oncology or infection cases
