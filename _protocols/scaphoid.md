title: Scaphoid fracture
body_part: Hand & Wrist
description: Fast limited scaphoid MRI protocol for the detection of fracture
---
This specialist, very fast limited scan can be used as 2nd or 3rd line imaging for suspected scaphoid fracture. It is a single plane, low detail scan which aims to detect bone marrow oedema and show a fracture line.

It needs to be carefully used, with education of referrers to understand that they are not getting an in depth scan of the wrist but a study to discover or discount the diagnosis of scaphoid fracure. In our practice, this is used as 2nd line imaging after 2 normal x-rays and review in the fracture clinic. It is typically carried out 10-14 days post-injury at the review appointment.
  
### Scan
- Superman position with hand in magnetic isocentre _or_ hand by flank if not tolerated
- High resolution hand / wrist coil if available
- 10-minute turnaround

| Sequence        | TE / TR / TI        | Slice / Gap / Matrix      |
|---              |---                  |---                        |
| T2 STIR Coronal | 50 / 4000 / 160ms   | 3.5mm / 0.4mm / 120 x 120 |
| T1 Coronal      | 10/ 300             | 3.5mm / 0.4mm / 120 x 120 |

#### What if I see some other pathology?
For this study it is **not** recommended that you carry out additional adhoc sequences because:
- This is deliberately a short 'fit in' scan
- It is intended as a problem solving focussed scan

### Notes for reporters
Quite often this study will be reported in a very simplistic manner as it is a focussed, question answering scan:

```No bone marrow oedema in the scaphoid. No scaphoid fracture detected.```

However, it is not at all infrequent to detect other fractures and it is important to describe the location of the other fracture but to appreciate that detail cannot be provided. 

```Bone marrow oedema is present in the triquetral suspect of fracture. No scaphoid bone marrow oedema.```

It is always worth mentioning the gross alignment of the carpal rows, as occasionally interval widening can be detected in relation to a ligament injury.

```The proximal and distal carpal rows remain normally aligned.```
