Suspected muscle injury of the thoracic or abdominal wall can be effectively investigated with MR within a realistic time frame from time of injury - discussion with MSK radiologist advised.

The patient is asked to place capsule markers at the site of pain and suspected injury to increase sensitivity of the examination.
