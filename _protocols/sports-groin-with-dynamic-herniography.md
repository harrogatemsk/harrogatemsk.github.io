  with dynamic stress sequences to increase sensitivity to hernia

### Indications

* Suspected inguinal canal hernia
* Anterior groin pain / inner thigh pain
* Sports injury to anterior groin / pelvic ring
* Symphysis pubis pathologies
* Sportsman's hernia

### Positioning

* Supine centred on MR couch

### Scan

* Body flex coil tightly applied over pelvis (ASIS is top landmark)
* FOV to cover entire width of pelvis

| Sequence						| Comments	| 
|---                  |           |
| PD Axial						| ASIS to bottom of inferior pubic rami	| 
| T1 Coronal					| Standard pelvic coronal plane	|
| STIR Coronal					| Standard pelvic coronal plane	| 
| PDFS Coronal Oblique			| Angled to pelvic outlet  | 
| TRUFISP realtime dynamic axial cine (2cm thick)	| Slice selected from axial study to cover level of superficial inguinal ring. Patient instructed to Valsalva strain for 2s and hold as sequence begins. Repeat 3 times	|

### Challenges

* **Tilting correctly for the Coronal Oblique** is best achieved with a sagittal planning sequence to take an angle between the ASIS and the symphysis pubis
* **Selecting the correct slice to cine scan** is perceived as challenging to some inexperienced radiographers. Staff education on how to identify the superficial inguinal ring and the course of the inguinal canal on MR helps.
* **Interpretation** should be carried out by an experienced subspecialist with an understanding of groin anatomy, hernia pathogenesis and experience reading dynamic examinations.
