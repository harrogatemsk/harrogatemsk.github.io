### Indications

* Suspected inguinal canal hernia
* Anterior groin pain / inner thigh pain
* Sports injury to anterior groin / pelvic ring
* Symphysis pubis pathologies
* Sports hernia / Adductor origin injury

### Positioning

* Supine centred on MR couch

### Scan

* Low centered pelvis and upper thighs

| Sequence						| Comments	| 
|---                  |           |
| PDFS Axial						| Inguinal canals and upper thighs	| 
| T1 Coronal					| Standard pelvic coronal plane, centre on symphysis pubis	|
| STIR Coronal					| As above, lower centring than usual hip scan	| 
| PDFS Coronal Oblique			| Angled to pelvic outlet  |
| PDFS Sagittal | Cover hip to hip, crossing symphysis pubis as centre point (middle of FOV) |

### Challenges

* **Tilting correctly for the Coronal Oblique** is best achieved with a sagittal planning sequence to take an angle between the ASIS and the symphysis pubis
* **Region of interest** is different to normal hip scan. Make sure that the symphysis pubis is the centre point level for ML and CC FOV. Ensure that some of the upper thigh is included in the scan to judge muscle sprain, especially on the sagittal image
