body_part: hip
desciption: Standard hip MRI protocol
---

Both hips are included in wide field of view making this a useful general protocol. An additional sagittal oblique sequence gives more detail on the affected hip and distinguishes this protocol from a basic pelvis.

This protocol is not a replacement for arthrography but is useful in patients falling outside of the arthrography criteria who can specify a painful side. It can also be used in patients on whom arthrography has been requested >50-years old (due to a very high rate of labral tears in this general population).

### Positioning
The patient lies supine with the pelvis well centred on the scan table.

### Scan
- Body coil
- Wide FOV images of whole pelvis (FOV 38cm)
- Narrower FOV sagittal oblique of affected hip (FOV 16cm)
