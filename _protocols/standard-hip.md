Ideal for musculotendinous injuries around the pelvis and the gross overview assessment of the hips, SI joints and symphysis pubis. Should be complemented with a more specific series if there is a target area or known problem to investigate for.

Both hips are included in wide field of view making this a useful general protocol. An additional sagittal oblique sequence gives more detail on the affected hip if a side of symptoms has been quoted.

This protocol is not a replacement for arthrography nor a fully detailed narrow FOV single hip scan. It is useful in a sport setting for high muscle injuries and assessment of the common hamstring tendon groups.

### Positioning
The patient lies supine with the pelvis well centred on the scan table.

### Coverage

The wide field of view images of the pelvis should start above the ASIS and finish 3cm below the ischial tuberosities.

The narrow FOV image of the single affected side should cover from the prominence of the external edge of the greater trochanter to a point just internal to the ischia tubersity, ensuring inclusion of the common hamstring tendon origin completely.

### Scan
- Body / Flex coil
- Wide FOV images of whole pelvis (FOV 38cm)
- Narrower FOV sagittal oblique of affected hip (FOV 16cm)
