### **Indications**

Standard wrist MRI has a wide range of applications, finding use in the assessment of:

* Tendons around the wrist

* Wrist and carpal joint cartilage

* Abutment syndromes (may not be optimal for suspected TFCC involvement)

### **Positioning**

* Superman position _or_ hand by side if not tolerated. Hand by side only works in a slim patient, as the coil must be as near to the magnetic isocentre as possible.

* Allow patient plenty of time to find comfortable position

* Encourage flexed elbow and relaxed shoulder extension rather than extreme positions

* Movement artefact is a problem due to patient discomfort in the superman position

### **MRI Scan**

* FOV to cover from 2cm proximal to wrist joint line _to_ bases of metacarpals
* High resolution hand and wrist coil
* Slice thickness 2.5mm with 10% gap

If struggling with homogeneity of fat saturation _especially_ when scanning with hand by side, consider alternative sequences
