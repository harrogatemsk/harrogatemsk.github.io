Dynamic, high resolution imaging of the temporomandibular joints to assess the articular disc in the open and closed mouth positions. Also includes cartilage optimised sequences
to detect osteoarthritis and joint effusions.

### Basic scan
- Head & neck coil
- FOV to cover angle of mandible to 1cm above TMJ (see images)

| Sequence              |

| PD sagittal oblique open mouth (each joint) 	|
| PD sagittal oblique closed mouth (each joint) |
| T1 coronal oblique (each joint) 	|
| PDFS coronal oblique (each joint) 	|
