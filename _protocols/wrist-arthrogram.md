### Indications
- TFCC tear
- Carpal ligament injury
- Carpal instability (specialist scan)

Patients must be referred by a **consultant orthopaedic surgeon** with vetting by **consultant radiologist**.

### Positioning
- Superman position _or_ hand by side if not tolerated. Hand by side only works in a slim patient, as the coil must be as near to the magnetic isocentre as possible.
- Allow patient plenty of time to find comfortable position
- Encourage flexed elbow and relaxed shoulder extension rather than extreme positions
- Movement artefact is a problem due to patient discomfort in the superman position

### Arthrogram
- Can be injected under fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance for TFCC or cartilage indications
- Fluoroscopy should be used for suspected ligament injury or carpal instability

#### General arthrogram technique


### MRI Scan
- FOV to cover from 2cm proximal to wrist joint line _to_ bases of metacarpals
- High resolution hand and wrist coil
