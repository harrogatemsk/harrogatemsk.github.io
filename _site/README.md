# Harrogate MSK Radiology
An open sourced collection of MRI scan protocols based on those in use at Harrogate District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Department of Musculoskeletal Radiology.

Detailed descriptions of use cases, scan preparation, technique and tips for most common musculoskeletal scenarios. These sequences were designed on a Siemens Aera 1.5T with dedicated coils (as specified). However, we have not listed scan parameters in a vendor specific manner and they could readily be used as a starting point on other brands and scanners.
